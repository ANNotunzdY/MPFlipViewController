MPFlipViewController
====================

A custom container view controller following the iOS 5 containment API that navigates between child view controllers via touch gestures and page-flip animations
  
This is the app to accompany my talk ["Implementing Custom Container View Controllers"](http://cocoaconf.com/conference/sessionDetails/82?confId=4) at [CocoaConf DC](http://cocoaconf.com/dc-2012/home) this Friday at 5 p.m.  
  
Full details will probably have to wait until the following week.  For now, I'll just put up this teaser screenshot.

Requirements
---------
* Xcode 4.3
* iOS 5
* ARC

How To Use
---------
Build and run the included demo app, and see how it works.

Licensing
---------
Read Source Code License.rtf, but the gist is:
* Anyone can use it for any type of project
* All I ask for is attribution somewhere

Best,
