MPFlipViewController
====================

A custom container view controller following the iOS 5 containment API that navigates between child view controllers via touch gestures and page-flip animations
  
Coming Friday June 29
=====================

This app will accompany my talk ["Implementing Custom Container View Controllers"](http://cocoaconf.com/conference/sessionDetails/82?confId=4) at [CocoaConf DC](http://cocoaconf.com/dc-2012/home) this Friday at 5 p.m.  

Full details will probably have to wait until the following week.  For now, I'll just put up this teaser screenshot.
